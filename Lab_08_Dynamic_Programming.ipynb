        "Dynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful optimization technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. Unlike mathematical programming approaches, DP provides a general and versatile framework that can address problems not easily formulated as linear or integer programs. (Many real-life problems often cannot be formulated as linear or mathematical programs.)\n",
        "\n",
        "In DP, the problem is divided into several stages, each with:\n",
        "- **Stages** $n = 1, 2, \\cdots, N$: A sequence of decision points.\n",

        "- **Decision Variables** $x_n$: The choices available at each stage, which affect the next state.\n",
        "- **Transition Relations** $s_{n+1} = g_n(s_n, x_n)$: Define how the system moves from one state to another based on the decision made.\n",
        "- **Immediate Return** $h_n(s_n, x_n)$: The reward or cost associated with each decision at each stage.\n",
